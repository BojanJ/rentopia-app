# React Hook Form Integration & API Error Handling Fix

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Page Reload on Form Validation Errors
The login page was reloading when API calls failed due to incorrect redirect logic in the component.

### 2. 401 Unauthorized Causing App Reload
The API client interceptor was treating all 401 responses the same way, including failed login attempts, causing automatic logout and page reload.

## 🔧 Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: useEffect for Authentication Redirect
Replaced immediate redirect logic with `useEffect` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and page reloads.

**Before (Problematic):**
```tsx
// This runs on every render, including when mutation fails
if (isAuthenticated) {
  navigate("/dashboard");
  return null;
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
// This only runs when isAuthenticated actually changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    navigate("/dashboard");
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, navigate]);
```

### Fix 2: Smarter 401 Error Handling
Modified the API client interceptor to distinguish between authentication endpoints and protected endpoints.

**Before (Problematic):**
```tsx
// This was logging out on ANY 401, including failed login attempts
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  const { logout } = useAuthStore.getState();
  logout();
  window.location.href = '/auth/login';
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
// Only logout on 401s for protected endpoints, not auth endpoints
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  const url = error.config?.url || '';
  const isAuthEndpoint = url.includes('/auth/login') || url.includes('/auth/register');
  
  if (!isAuthEndpoint) {
    const { logout } = useAuthStore.getState();
    logout();
    window.location.href = '/auth/login';
  }
}
```

## ✅ Changes Made
1. **LoginPage.tsx**: Added `useEffect` for proper redirect handling
2. **RegisterPage.tsx**: Added `useEffect` for proper redirect handling  
3. **apiClient.ts**: Fixed 401 error handling to exclude auth endpoints
4. **Imports**: Added `useEffect` import to both auth components

## 🧪 Testing
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter wrong credentials
3. Form should show validation errors **without page reload**
4. Error messages should persist and be visible
5. Only successful authentication should trigger navigation
6. Failed login attempts should not cause logout/reload

## 📋 Benefits
- ✅ No more page reloads on failed authentication
- ✅ Better user experience with persistent error messages  
- ✅ Proper React component lifecycle management
- ✅ Maintains React Hook Form state during validation errors
- ✅ Distinguishes between failed login attempts and expired sessions
- ✅ Preserves user context during authentication errors
